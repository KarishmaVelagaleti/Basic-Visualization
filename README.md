# Basic-Visualization

This repository is a good refresher for many different kinds of visualizations in Seaborn. Some key visualizations that you will see in this repo are: 

1. Distplot
2. Jointplot
3. Rug plot 
4. Bar plot 
5. count plot 
6. box plot (note: I believe box plot and many other plots are now replaced with cat plot to essentially include different kinds of plots - box, strip, swarm etc)
7. strip plot
8. factor plot

For numerical variables certain plots are really useful - 
1. Heatmap
2. Clustermap 
3. Pair plot 
4. Facetgrid 
5. lmplot - very useful for linear regression!


The basic visualization notebook includes many basics including parameters for different plots.
